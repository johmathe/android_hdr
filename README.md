HDR app for android
Code for group 8: Johan Mathe, Tim M Wong
EE368, Stanford University, Electrical Engineering

This project is an HDR application for the android phone.

To load this code, you will need:

- Eclipse
- The run-jetty-run eclipse plugin
- The android eclipse plugin

There are 2 projects to load in eclipse:
- HDR, the android phone app. Android 2.2 only!
- HDR Merge, the server app

This code is a client-server app. You need to run the server, find out it's IP address, update the android code with this particular IP address, and load the android app on the phone.

You will also need to redefine the libraries paths, that are included in this package.

Enjoy HDR processing :)
